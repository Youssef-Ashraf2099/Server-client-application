# Server-client-application
the aim of the project is to connect the client with server using TCP flow
so to start the project first insert the IP address of the server using ipconfig command you will find the IP address and insert it in the string section of the server class
then start the server class before the client as if you started with the client there is nothing to connect to so we run the server first
after we run the server we run the client server and type "CONNECT" in this way so the client conncet to the server after that you can start chat with the server send and recive from both server and client
and finally when the client want to disconnect the client write "QUIT" so the client exit the chat
